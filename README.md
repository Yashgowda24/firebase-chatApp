# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Project Goal

The objective is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter apps. I have used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.

This is a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.

## What I learnt:

- How to incorporate Firebase into Flutter projects.
- How to use Firebase authentication to register and sign in users.
- How to create beautiful animations using the Flutter Hero widget.
- How to create custom aniamtions using Flutter's animation controller.
- Learn all about mixins and how they differ from superclasses.
- Learn about Streams and how they work.
- Learn to use ListViews to build scrolling views.
- How to use Firebase Cloud Firestore to store and retrieve data on the fly.

1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Register an Android app with package name `com.yash.chat_app` (or whatever you used).
